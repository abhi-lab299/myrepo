Docker is a container-based virtualization technology that uses OS-level isolation to run applications in self-contained environments,
sharing the host operating system kernel while remaining independent from each other.

📦 What is a Container?

A container includes:

Application source code

Runtime (e.g., Java, Node.js, Python)

System libraries

Environment variables

Configuration files

✅ All bundled into one executable unit
