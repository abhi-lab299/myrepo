🚀 Docker — Technical Overview

Docker is an open-source containerization platform that enables applications to be built, packaged, and executed in lightweight, isolated environments known as containers.

Docker leverages OS-level virtualization to encapsulate an application along with its runtime, system libraries, dependencies, and configuration files, ensuring environmental consistency across development, testing, and production.

Unlike traditional virtual machines, Docker containers share the host operating system kernel, making them faster, more efficient, and highly portable.

🧱 Core Architecture Components
🐳 Docker Engine

The backbone of Docker, responsible for container lifecycle management.

Docker Daemon (dockerd) – Manages images, containers, networks, and volumes

REST API – Enables programmatic interaction

Docker CLI – Command-line interface for user interaction

📦 Docker Image

A layered, immutable blueprint used to create containers.
Images are built using a Dockerfile and follow a copy-on-write filesystem model.

▶️ Docker Container

A runtime instance of a Docker image, providing:

Process isolation via Linux namespaces

Resource control via cgroups

📝 Dockerfile

A declarative configuration file that defines how an image is built, including:

Base image

Dependencies

Environment variables

Startup commands

🌐 Docker Registry

A centralized image repository for storage and distribution.
Examples:

Docker Hub

Amazon ECR

GitHub Container Registry
